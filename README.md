# Terraform Provider for TIBCO Cloud Mashery

This is an experimental Terraform provider for TIBCO Cloud Mashery. It is written 
largely for the proof-of-concept/educational purposes to investigate the possibility of 
managing Mashery deployment from the Terraform-based CI/CD.

Using this provider requires being Mashery customer and understanding how to authenticate
the Terraform process.
